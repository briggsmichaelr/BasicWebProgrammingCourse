# Review Exercise

We will try to put together what we have learned into one exercise. 

Make any program that uses classes, objects, loops, functions, and inequality conditionals. YOou do not need to use all, but try to use as many as possible.

For example, previously we made a function that uses a Customer class to create Customer objects which have methods that use function includeing the listServices() method that utilizes a loop.

Please be creative. We will post submitted code if the author agrees to their code being shared.
