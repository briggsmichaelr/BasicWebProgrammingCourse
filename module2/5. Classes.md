# Classes

This page is under construction, but will include details about classes. 

A Class is a prototype for objects. Classes allow you to quickly create objects that you can use later. Lets see how we can use Classes to simplify our object creation process from earlier.

``` JavaScript
Class Customer = {
  constructor(name,email,age){
    this.Name=name;
    this.Email=email;
    this.Age=age;
  },
  Services: [],
  email: function () {
    //In reality this section would be used to send the email, but here it is just a placeholder
    console.log(
      this.Name + " has been emailed at email address: " + this.Email
    );
  },
  subscribe: function (service) {
    this.Services[this.Services.length] = service;
  },
  listServices: function () {
    console.log(this.Name + "'s Services:");
    for (let Service of this.Services) {
      console.log(Service);
    }
  }
};

let Mike = new Customer("Mike", "fake@email.com", 18);

Mike.email();
Mike.subscribe("Reminders");
Mike.listServices();
```
