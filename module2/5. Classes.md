# Classes

This page is under construction, but will include details about classes. 

A Class is a prototype for objects. Classes allow you to quickly create objects that you can use later. Lets see how we can use Classes to simplify our object creation process from earlier.

``` JavaScript
class Customer {
  constructor(name, email, age) {
    this.Name = name;
    this.Email = email;
    this.Age = age;
    this.Services = [];
  }
  email() {
    //In reality this section would be used to send the email, but here it is just a placeholder
    console.log(
      this.Name + " has been emailed at email address: " + this.Email
    );
  }
  subscribe(service) {
    this.Services[this.Services.length] = service;
  }
  listServices() {
    console.log(this.Name + "'s Services:");
    for (let Service of this.Services) {
      console.log(Service);
    }
  }
}

let Mike = new Customer("Mike", "fake@email.com", 18);
let Jorge = new Customer("Jorge", "jorge@email.com", 28);

Mike.email();
Mike.subscribe("Reminders");
Mike.subscribe("Email");
Mike.listServices();

Jorge.subscribe("Calendar");
Jorge.subscribe("Reminders");
Jorge.listServices();
```

Now in your command line run `node program.js` to run your code.

Output: 

```
Mike has been emailed at email address: fake@email.com 
Mike's Services: 
Reminders 
Email 
Jorge's Services: 
Calendar 
Reminders 
```
