# Basic Web Programming Course

## Syllabus:

### Purpose of the class:
For complete beginners to learn the basic principles of computer programming and to have the skills needed to make a useful web pages. 

### Time Commitment:
While the time spent is flexible and up to the student, it might be hard to keep up with the course if less than one hour a week is spent on the course. We plan to meet in person for one hour every week so even if the student only comes to the in-person meeting they should be able to keep up with the content, but will likely not be able to master or explore deeper. 

### Content:
We will start with basic programming principles, then move quickly to getting that content deployed so it can be viewed by others, finally we will use state of the art tools to improve upon the content created by students. By the end of the course students should be able to make production web apps that can be used by anyone with internet access. 

Students are highly encouraged to create content and give feedback to other students and the teacher. Not only will this help students learn better and more effectively, it will create a portfolio of work that can be shown to future employers to demonstrate the studentsâ€™ knowledge.

All content will be posted online on GitHub. If an in-person class is missed, a student should be able to catch up on their own. The Modules can be accessed on the top of the repository page or through the links in the schedule below.
