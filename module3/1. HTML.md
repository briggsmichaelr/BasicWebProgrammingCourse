# HTML

There are three main programming languages that are vital to know for web development. JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. JavaScript is what we have been 
working with so far. It is the logic of the web. JavaScript alows for the webpage to be interactive, to change, and to send and receive information. 
CSS handles styling, what color or size the content is. Finally HTML is the basic structure of the webpage. It tells the computer what content to display 
and in what order.

HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language and is the backbone of the internet. All internet webpages use HTML to display the content. The format of HTML
is HTML elements and the content of those elements. The elements are specified using opening and closing tags with the content of the element located 
within those tags. All elements are of the form `<elementName> Content of the element </elementName>`. At the begining of the file, you must declare 
that you will use html by typing `<!DOCTYPE html>` let's see an example HTML document.

``` html
