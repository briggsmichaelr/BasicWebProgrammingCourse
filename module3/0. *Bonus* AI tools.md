# AI tools that can help with programming

In the last couple of years, some very helpful AI tools have come out that can be very valuable for learning programming and writing code. 
We will look at two of these tools and the benefits they can give.

## ChatGPT
 - ChatGPT is a large language model developed by OpenAI, which is capable of generating human-like text. It can be used to help with a variety of tasks, such as writing code, answering questions, and generating natural-sounding responses to user input.
 - When learning programming, ChatGPT can be a useful tool in several ways. For example, it can help you:
 - Understand and explain complex programming concepts: You can ask ChatGPT to explain a certain concept or provide examples of how a particular programming language or library works, and it will generate a human-like response that is easy to understand.
 - Write code: You can ask ChatGPT to write code snippets for you, and it will generate syntactically correct code that follows best practices and conventions.
 - Debug code: You can give ChatGPT your code and ask it to identify errors or suggest improvements, and it will generate a response that helps you fix the issues.
 - Learn new programming languages and libraries: You can ask ChatGPT to provide tutorials or resources for learning a new programming language or library, and it will generate a list of relevant resources and tips.

Additionally, ChatGPT can help you quickly generate repetitive code, help you with suggestions on how to improve your code, and help you with the understanding of concepts by providing examples.

## CoPilot
CoPilot is a tool developed by OpenAI that is designed to help beginners learn programming by providing real-time assistance as they write code. It is built on top of the GPT-3 language model, which allows it to understand code and provide suggestions, explanations, and feedback as the user writes.

- CoPilot can help beginning programmers in several ways. For example, it can:
- Provide context-aware autocomplete suggestions: As the user types, CoPilot will suggest code snippets that are relevant to the current context, making it easier for the user to write and understand the code.
- Explain programming concepts: CoPilot can explain programming concepts in simple, easy-to-understand language, helping the user to understand the code they are writing.
- Identify errors: CoPilot can detect errors in the code as the user writes, providing feedback and suggestions for how to fix them.
- Provide guidance and feedback: CoPilot can provide guidance and feedback as the user writes code, helping them to improve their coding skills and write better code.
- Help users discover new libraries, modules, and functions: By providing suggestions for new libraries, modules, and functions that are relevant to the user's code, CoPilot can help users discover new tools that can help them improve their code.

In general, CoPilot's goal is to help beginning programmers become more productive and confident when writing code. It does this by providing real-time assistance and feedback that can help users overcome common challenges and improve their coding skills.
